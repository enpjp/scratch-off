This scratch off demo is presented as a stand-alone app that should run in any web browser.
Not all browsers will run it from a file. If this is the case use a local server app like the Chrome 200OK! web server.

Note that the code is written with a jQuery container so it may be embedded within a CMS webpage. If this is the intent, then only use the code between the body tags. You may need to change the link to the jQuery library to get the code to work if it is embedded in a web page. On an Info-Point you would use the special content type to do this.

The easiest way to use this demo on an Info-Point is to upload the scratch-off directory and all its contents to the www directory on the Info-Point. The demo may then be run by naviaging to: http://ip.lan/scratch-off/ or http://ip.lan/scratch-off/index.html

For multiple scratch-offs copy the index.html to <new-name>.html adjust the urls to match your new image files at line 50 and 51. The new demo is then run by navigating to http://ip.lan/scratch-off/<new-name>.html.

Enjoy.
